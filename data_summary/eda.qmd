## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- datasets::ChickWeight |> as_tibble()
df

```

You can add options to executable code like this 


```{r}

df2  <-  df |> group_by(Diet, Time) |> 
            summarise(avg_weigt = mean(weight))

df2
```

```{r}
df2 |> 
    ggplot(aes(Time, avg_weigt, color = Diet)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
